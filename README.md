Monty Interpreter
Introduction
Welcome to the Monty Interpreter project! This collaborative effort between James Gitere and Charity Nyamamba. The Monty Interpreter is designed to execute Monty programming language code.
LIFO and FIFO
In this project, we implement the concepts of Last In, First Out (LIFO) and First In, First Out (FIFO). Understanding these principles is crucial for proper execution of Monty code.

Stack
A stack is utilized to follow the LIFO principle. It's employed for tracking the order of elements, where the last item added is the first one processed or removed.

Queue
The queue follows the FIFO principle. It maintains the order in which elements are added, ensuring that the first item added is processed or removed first.
